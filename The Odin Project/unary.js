/*

The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesnâ€™t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert( +x ); // 1

let y = -2;
alert( +y ); // -2

// Converts non-numbers
alert( +true ); // 1
alert( +"" );   // 0

let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings
