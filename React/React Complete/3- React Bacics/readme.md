* React is all about components (like lego, building blocks)
* Components because --> Reusability (don't repeat yourself), separation of concers (don't doo too many things in one and the same place(function))
* Each component has one specific task that it focuses on
* Declarative Approach -> React allows you to create reusable and reactice components consisting of html, css and js, no need to deal with event listener etc :)
* You write jsx (developer friendly language), and it translated into regular html that browser can understand behind the scenes
* Component is basically just a javascript function
